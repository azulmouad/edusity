# Edusity

Edusity is a website built using React.js, and it marks one of my first projects with React. The project is set up with Vite to enable fast and efficient development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and includes some ESLint rules for maintaining code quality.

## Features

- **Vite Integration**: Utilizes Vite for quick project setup and efficient development.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Instant updates without full page reloads.
- **ESLint**: Enforced code quality and consistency.

## React Plugins

This project currently supports two official plugins for Fast Refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) - Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) - Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

## Project Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with the following key features:

- Fast and efficient development with HMR.
- Integration with ESLint for code quality.
- Configurable options for using Babel or SWC.

Feel free to explore the code and make improvements or add new features as needed!

## Acknowledgements
